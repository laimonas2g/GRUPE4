JavaScript IF/ELSE Exercises
Here are some practice IF/ELSE Exercises for beginner JavaScript developers focusing on if, else, and else if statements:
Basic Conditional Logic:
1. Positive/Negative/Zero:
Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs whether it's positive, negative, or zero. 
2. Even/Odd:
Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. 
3. Largest of Two:
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs the larger one. 
4. Grade Converter:
Write a program that converts a numerical grade (0-100) to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). 
5. Ticket Pricing:
Write a program that calculates the price of a movie ticket based on age, with different prices for children, teenagers, adults, and seniors. 
More Complex Conditional Logic: 
1. Leap Year Checker:
Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year.
2. Discount Calculator:
Write a program that calculates a discount based on the purchase amount, with different discount percentages for different price ranges.
3. Time-Based Greeting:
Write a program that greets the user with "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" based on the current time.
4. BMI Calculator:
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes it (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).
5. Number Guessing Game:
Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number, and the program provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct). 
Advanced:
1. Login/Logout:
Write a program that simulates a login/logout functionality. The program should toggle a loggedIn variable between true and false each time a button (or other input) is triggered.
2. Animal Sounds:
Create a program that identifies an animal based on user input and prints the corresponding sound (e.g., "cat" -> "meow", "dog" -> "woof", "cow" -> "moo").
3. Day of the Week:
Write a program that takes a number (1-7) as input and outputs the corresponding day of the week.
4. Grading System:
Create a grading system that takes a student's score as input and assigns a letter grade based on a set of rules (e.g., 90-100 is an A, 80-89 is a B, etc.).
5. Traffic Light:
Create a simple traffic light simulation that changes the color of the light (red, yellow, green) based on a timer or user input. 

Basic Conditional Logic:
Even/Odd Checker: Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs whether it's even or odd. 
Positive/Negative/Zero: Write a program that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero. 
Age Checker: Write a program that checks if a person is old enough to vote (e.g., 18 years or older). 
Number Comparison: Write a program that compares two numbers and outputs the larger one. 
Grade Converter: Write a program that converts a numerical grade (0-100) to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). 
Simple Calculator: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. Use if and else if to handle different operations. 
Leap Year Checker: Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year. 
More Advanced Conditional Logic:
1. Discount Calculator:
Write a program that calculates a discount based on the purchase amount. For example:
If the purchase amount is greater than or equal to 100, apply a 20% discount.
If the purchase amount is greater than or equal to 50, apply a 10% discount.
Otherwise, no discount. 
2. Time-Based Greeting:
Write a program that greets the user based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning", "Good afternoon", "Good evening"). 
3. Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator:
Write a program that calculates BMI based on weight and height and categorizes it (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight). 
4. Number Guessing Game:
Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. Provide feedback (higher, lower, correct) based on the guess. 
5. Animal Sounds:
Write a program that checks if a given animal is a cat or a dog and outputs the corresponding sound ("meow" or "woof"). If it's neither, output "Unknown animal". 
Tips for Solving:
Start simple: Break down the problem into smaller parts.
Use console.log(): Print intermediate values to see what's happening in your code.
Test your code: Make sure your code works for different inputs.
Consider edge cases: Think about unusual inputs that your code might need to handle.
Read the documentation: Refer to MDN Web Docs or W3Schools for syntax and usage of if and else statements.

Write a program that determines whether a given number is positive or negative.
Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
Write a program to determine the greater of two numbers.
Write a program that transforms a numerical grade to a letter grade (e.g grade 10 should display “A”).
Write a program that calculates the ticket price based on age with the following conditions: age below 12 pay a ticket price of 5, age below 18 pay a ticket price of 10, age below 60 pay a ticket price of 20, age over 60 play a ticket price of 15.
Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year.
Write a program that calculates a discount based on the purchase amount.Prices equal or over 100 discount have a discount of 20. Prices equal or over 50 have a discount of 10. Otherwise discount is 0
