          <b>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw
          physical force.</b><br>
          <p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body
          through a
          space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain
          kinds of Strength checks.</p>

              tricky
              footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of

            <p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills
              apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than
              involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your
              attempt
              to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>

            <p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive
              reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain
              kinds

              things
              about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception,
